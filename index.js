// What is algorithm?
// An algorithm is a set of instructions or steps for solving a problem or achieving a specific task. Algorithms can be expressed using natural language, pseudocode, or programming languages. They are used in many fields, including mathematics, computer science, and operations research. An algorithm must be clear, unambiguous and have a finite number of steps. The efficiency of an algorithm can be analyzed using computational complexity theory.

// Why should you learn algorithms?
// 01. Problem-solving: Understanding algorithms allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps, and find efficient solutions.

// 02. Computer Science: Algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science and are used in many areas such as data structures, databases, computer networks, and artificial intelligence.

// 03. Career Advancement: Knowledge of algorithms and data structures is highly valued in the tech industry, and can lead to opportunities for career advancement in fields such as software development and data analysis.

// 04. Critical thinking and abstraction: Learning algorithms can help develop critical thinking and abstraction skills, which are useful in many areas.

// 05. Understanding technology: Algorithms are used in many technologies that we use daily, understanding how they work can help you use them more effectively and make better decisions about technology.
